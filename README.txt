ANALYSIS


Mini-Max Sum:

Time complexity = O(n^2), 
because there are two nested for loops that are based on n, the size of the given array

Space complexity = O(n),
since the algorithm takes an array of n size as input.




Hackerrank string:

Time complexity = O(n),
becuase there is one for loop that is a length of n, the size of the given string.

Space complexity = O(n),
since the algorithm takes a string of n length as input.
